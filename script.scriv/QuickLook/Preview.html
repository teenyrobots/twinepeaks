The latter tendency had prevailed when he accepted Raymond's invi...</p>

He chose the nearer date, and found Villiers sitting as usual by the window, apparently lost in meditation on the drowsy traffic of the street. There was a bamboo table by his side, a fantastic thing, enriched with gilding and queer painted scenes, and on it lay a little pile of papers arranged and docketed as neatly as anything in Mr. Clarke's office.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p></p>
